# Sultans Maze II
This is my attempt to write a faster and slightly enhanced version of the Amsoft game Sultans Maze.

You will get a choice of 255 procedrally generated mazes.  Your energy will go down slowly with each move,
but if you meet the ghost it will push you back and take 50 energy.  You can not leave the maze until you
have collected all the gems.

Keys are:  
`A` and `D` to turn left and right.  
`W` and `S` to move forward and backwards.  
`Q` to quit

# Version History

Same as 0.1 but only redraw area round player and ghost to speed up play.

## 0.1
Simple ASCII version with top down view wile I work on maze generation and game mechanic.
